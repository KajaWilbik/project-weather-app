## The problem

Biggest problem was how to work in branches, merge different branches, also rememeber the terminal usage details when after editing in the branch. 

Jessica had problem with pulled request on a branch which ended up in the technigo master, later she found out the upstream had some issues, so ended up sticking with terminal and terminal only. 

Kaja had some problem with conditional statement, but after many fails and trails, she made it work and it works beautifully.
